## Description
The theremin is an electronic musical instrument invented by Leon Theremin in 1920. It has two antennas, one for volume and one for tone. The tone of the apparatus is the result of a process of heterodynization of a signal at a reference frequency with a variable frequency oscillator, whose frequency depends on the distance from the hand to the tone antenna. One of the difficulties of learning the theremin is that there is no direct cue about which position of the hand produce a specific note. The only feedback provided is the tone produced. 

We propose the use of computer vision through the OAKD device in order to provide assited learning and playing for the theremin. The project has 4 subsystems that use computer vision models:

+ Theremin Simulator.
+ Calibration: Tone function.
+ Calibration: Body and Theremin location.
+ Assisted Practicing System.

## Roadmap

Due to some logistic problems. 

### 1. Theremin Simulator

### 2. Calibration: Tone Function

### 3. Calibration: Body and Theremin Location

### 4. Assited Practicing System
